# Pharmacy Management System - Detailed Development Plan

## Information Gathered
- The project is a web-based Pharmacy Management System aimed at automating inventory, sales, prescriptions, and customer management.

- Missing features identified by the user include purchase order system, goods receipt, barcode scanning, batch/lot tracking, stock movement history, reorder alerts, supplier performance tracking, inventory valuation, expired stock write-off.
